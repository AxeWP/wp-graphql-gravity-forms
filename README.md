# WPGraphQL for Gravity Forms
This WordPress plugin provides a GraphQL API for interacting with Gravity Forms. It is currently an unfinished work in progress.

## Getting Started
1. Use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to require the plugin as a dependency of your project. Alternatively, you can download it into your `plugins` directory, just like any other WordPress plugin.
1. Activate the plugin, along with the [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/) and [Gravity Forms](https://www.gravityforms.com/) plugins that it depends on.
1. At this point, you can use a tool like [GraphiQL](https://electronjs.org/apps/graphiql) to view the schema and send a few test requests to your `/graphql` endpoint to interact with Gravity Forms data.
